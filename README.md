## Introduction
As a Big Data Analytics intern at Kimia Farma, I've had the opportunity to evaluate Kimia Farma's business performance from 2020 to 2023. This task requires a deep understanding of data and analytical capabilities, along with technical skills in SQL querying and dashboard analytics development. Focused on implementing Big Data solutions, this project aims to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making within the pharmaceutical and healthcare technology industry.

The dataset consists of four main tables:
1. **kf_final_transaction**: This table contains information about the last transaction performed. Each row represents one transaction and includes details such as transaction ID code, product ID, branch ID, customer name, transaction date, product price, discount percentage, and customer rating of the transaction.
2. **kf_inventory**: This table stores information about the inventory of medicinal products in each Kimia Farma branch. This includes inventory ID, branch ID, product ID, product name, and the number of medicinal product stocks available at each branch.
3. **kf_office_branch**: This table contains information about Kimia Farma branch offices. Each row includes details such as branch ID, branch category, branch name, branch city, branch province, and customer rating of the branch.
